## About me

I am a results oriented software developer currently working in the finance industry. I seek to keep myself in constant growth and multidisciplinary training.
I love to design strategies for specific business needs and look for mathematical solutions to solve problems.

🔹 I develop software that perfectly adapts to your business needs.

🔹 I'm always looking for a way to automate processes, able to lead.

🔹 One of the most liked cores by myself are analyzing data, normalizing, structuring and debugging huge databases -> focusing on good practices, getting specific information and representing it visually.

## Hobbies

♦ Systems design | corporate presentations | Documentation.

♦ Powerlifting.

♦ Read about (math, medicine, productivity, tech, others)
